<article><h1>I finally made my site look not terrible</h1><h5>Jan 31, 2018 / <a href="http://xenonnsmb.com/">Back to homepage</a></h5>
<p><p>I bought this domain name in 2014 and originally it didn&rsquo;t have anything on it until I decided to point it to a GitHub Pages website. Originally I just made it by editing in an HTML editor and I decided to make everything be in a monospace font for some f<span class="censor">cc</span>king reason (I think I wanted it to look like a terminal or something) but it mostly never had any content (unless you can call <a href="/emojify/">this</a> and <a href="/perispin/">this</a> content) until I came up with the brilliant idea to stick a Hugo blog here and make it be totally separated from the rest of the site by using a Hugo default theme and making only the blog be generated with Hugo. Eventually I realized that was a f<span class="censor">cc</span>king stupid idea so I took my HTML from 2014, copy pasted Hugo magic words into it, and generated the whole site with it. But it still annoyed me because it didn&rsquo;t look that good and because of this thing in Google search results:<br><br><img src="/img/mobilefriendly.png" style="max-width:300px;"><br><br>But I never bothered to redesign it for a while because I never really write that much here anyway, but I wanna do it more and I feel like this place deserves better treatment than it gets. So here you go, now it actually looks readable and as a bonus I made it &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; by having everything be 600px max width on screens wider than 600px, and 100% width on screens smaller. Hopefully now it&rsquo;s actually usable on mobile. I am aware that nobody else is ever going to care about this or read it but if you&rsquo;re doing that right now then I guess you proved me wrong.</p>
